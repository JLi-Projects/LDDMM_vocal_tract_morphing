# LDDMM_vocal_tract_morphing
The main file containing the code for LDDMM vocal tract morphing is LDDMM_vocal_tract_transformation.ipynb. To get this file to work, use the environment.yaml file to setup a virtual environment, then setup an iPython kernel inside this virtual environment. This may not work because this yaml file was generated from exporting all the packages in the virtual environment I used to run the code, and this method has proved to be temperamental in the past. In that case, using the environment_original.yaml file will be guaranteed to work, but there will be missing dependencies that I needed to install manually to get the code to work.
